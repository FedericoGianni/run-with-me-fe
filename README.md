## Intro
The objective of the app is to provide a platform in which users can find or propose
running events, giving a starting place and time, and the expected distance and time to
complete.

Users can subscribe to other events or create their own, choosing the maximum number
of allowed participants. The backend will calculate a difficulty level between 0-5 for each
proposed run, to suggest event based on the usersâ€™ fitness level, which is calculated by
requiring some questions during registration.

Even if a user is not registered, he/she can still browse events. Registration is then
required if he/she wants to subscribe. We made this choice because many application
do not allow to interact without registering first, which can be a deterrent
