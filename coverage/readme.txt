I ran into the same problem when attempting to use lcov through WSL, and I have figured out the issue.

The lcov file generated by flutter test --coverage on Windows has back slashes \ for paths instead of forward slashes /.

Simply replacing all back slashes in your lcov.info file with forward slashes before running genhtml, should resolve the issue.
